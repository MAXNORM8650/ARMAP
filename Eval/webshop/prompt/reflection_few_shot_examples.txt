You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.
Now you are trying to evaluate your performance on a past task. You will be given the objective of the task, the history of interaction including the observations you had and the actions you issued, and the status of the task. You will also be given the memory of your previous attempts. Your goal is to think about the strategy and path you took to attempt to complete the task. Try to summarize the reason why you failed to complete the task, and devise a concise, new plan that accounts for your mistake and can be helpful when you are solving the same task. Try to think differently from the previous attempts. Try to focus on the key aspect and make the plan concise.

\n\nHuman: Observation: OK.
\n\nAssistant: Action: click[variety pack]

\n\nAssistant: Action: click[0.8 ounce (pack of 24)]
\n\nHuman: Observation: You have clicked 0.8 ounce (pack of 24).
\n\nAssistant: Action: click[Buy Now]

STATUS: FAIL

Next plan: In this attempt, I was unsuccessful. I accidentally bought a product that was $100, which is more than my budget of $30. Either way, the initial search results were not good. Next time, I will do search["variety pack of chips"] and then check if the results meet the dairy free and the $30 budget constraints. I will continue to refine my searches so that I can find more products.

STATUS: FAIL

Next plan: In this attempt, I was unsuccessful. The initial search results were not the products that I was looking for. Next time, I will do search["vegetarian bacon"] for a broader search. I will check that the new results will fulfill the gluten free and 4 ounce pack of 2 constraints. I will continue to refine my searches so that I can find more products.
