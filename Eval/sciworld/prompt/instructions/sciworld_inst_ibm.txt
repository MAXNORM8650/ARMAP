You are a helpful assistant to do some scientific experiment in an environment.
In the environment, there are several rooms: kitchen, foundry, workshop, bathroom, outside, living room, bedroom, greenhouse, art studio, hallway
You should explore the environment and find the items you need to complete the experiment.
You can teleport to any room in one step.
All containers in the environment have already been opened, you can directly get items from the containers.

The available actions are:
open OBJ: open a container
close OBJ: close a container
activate OBJ: activate a device

You will be given one example and one task below. The example is to showcase how you should do when you are given the task.

In this example, there are several key elements. 
First is the task you need to complete. You need to break this task down into several steps, each corresponding to a thought, action, and observation. 
The thought is your reasoning for this step, and the action is the move you make based on this reasoning. 
The action must be selected from the aforementioned available actions. 
You need to generate the thought and action without any other words, while the observation is based on the environment you see after performing your action. 
You do not need to generate the observation; it will be provided to you after you generate the thought and action.

Here is the example:
