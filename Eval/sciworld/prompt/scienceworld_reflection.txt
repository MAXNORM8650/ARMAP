You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the strategy and path you took to attempt to complete the task. Devise a concise, new plan of action that accounts for your mistake with reference to specific actions that you should have taken. For example, if you tried A and B but forgot C, then devise a plan to achieve C with environment-specific actions. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Give your plan after "Plan". Here are two examples:

Instruction:
Your task is to find a(n) animal. First, focus on the thing. Then, move it to the purple box in the bedroom.
Thought: I need to find an animal to move to the purple box in the bedroom. I'll start by focusing on the task and then searching for the animal.
Action: teleport to bedroom
Observation: You teleport to the bedroom.
Thought: I'm in the bedroom now. I don't see any animals, but I do see a few containers. I'll take a closer look around.
Action: look around
Observation: This room is called the bedroom. In it, you see: 
        the agent
        a substance called air
        a bed. On the bed is: a mattress. On the mattress is: a white pillow..
        a book shelf (containing A book (Moby Dick) titled Moby Dick by Herman Melville)
        a closet. The closet door is open. In the closet is: nothing.
        a finger painting
        a purple box (containing nothing)
        a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
        A door to the hallway (that is open)
Thought: I don't see any animals in the bedroom, but I do see a few potential leads. I'll take a closer look at the closet and the bookshelf.
Action: examine bookshelf
Observation: No known action matches that input.
Thought: I guess "examine bookshelf" isn't a valid action. I'll try something else. I'll take a closer look at the closet instead.
Action: look at closet
Observation: a closet. The closet door is open. In the closet is: 
        nothing
Thought: Hmm, the closet is empty. I'll think about what else I can do. I see a bookshelf with a book on it, and I also see a door to the hallway. Maybe I can find something useful in the hallway.
Action: teleport to hallway
Observation: You teleport to the hallway.
Thought: I'm in the hallway now. It's a long, narrow corridor with doors leading to different rooms. I don't see any animals, but I do see a few doors that might be worth checking out. I'll take a closer look around.
Action: look around
Observation: This room is called the hallway. In it, you see: 
        the agent
        a substance called air
        a adult bee
        a picture
You also see:
        A door to the art studio (that is open)
        A door to the bedroom (that is open)
        A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
        A door to the kitchen (that is open)
        A door to the living room (that is open)
        A door to the workshop (that is open)
Thought: Ah, I see an adult bee in the hallway! That's exactly what I was looking for. I'll pick it up and move it to the purple box in the bedroom.
Action: pick up adult bee
Observation: You move the bee 2 to the inventory.
Thought: I've picked up the bee, but I need to move it to the purple box in the bedroom. I'll teleport to the bedroom and then move the bee to the box.
Action: teleport to bedroom
Observation: You teleport to the bedroom.
Thought: I'm back in the bedroom. I'll move the bee to the purple box.
Action: move adult bee to purple box
Observation: No known action matches that input.
Thought: Hmm, it looks like I can't directly move the bee to the purple box. I'll try to pick up the bee from my inventory and then move it to the box.
Action: pick up adult bee
Observation: No known action matches that input.
Thought: I guess I can't pick up the bee from my inventory. I'll try to use the bee from my inventory instead.
Action: use adult bee
Observation: No known action matches that input.

STATUS: FAIL

New plan: Start by teleporting directly to the hallway to increase the likelihood of encountering an animal more quickly. Once the adult bee is located in the hallway, pick it up and then teleport back to the bedroom. To ensure the bee is successfully placed in the purple box, try using specific commands that might be recognized by the system which could potentially align better with the system's acceptable actions. If initial attempts fail, reevaluate the available actions for clues on how to interact with objects and inventory effectively.

Instruction: 
Your task is to measure the temperature of unknown substance B, which is located around the bedroom. First, focus on the thermometer. Next, focus on the unknown substance B. If the unknown substance B temperature is above 200.0 degrees celsius, place it in the yellow box. If the unknown substance B temperature is below 200.0 degrees celsius, place it in the purple box. The boxes are located around the bathroom.
Thought: I need to start by focusing on the thermometer to prepare it for measuring the temperature of unknown substance B. Then, I'll focus on the unknown substance B to take its temperature. After that, I'll decide which box to place it in based on its temperature.
Action: focus on thermometer
Observation: No known action matches that input.
Thought: I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I need to specify the action more clearly. I'll try again.
Action: look around
Observation: This room is called the hallway. In it, you see: 
        the agent
        a substance called air
        a painting
You also see:
        A door to the art studio (that is open)
        A door to the bedroom (that is open)
        A door to the greenhouse (that is open)
        A door to the kitchen (that is open)
        A door to the living room (that is open)
        A door to the workshop (that is open)
Thought: I'm currently in the hallway, and I need to get to the bedroom to find the unknown substance B. I'll teleport to the bedroom to start the task.
Action: teleport to bedroom
Observation: You teleport to the bedroom.
Thought: I'm now in the bedroom. I need to find the unknown substance B. I'll look around the room to see if I can spot it.
Action: look around
Observation: This room is called the bedroom. In it, you see: 
        the agent
        a substance called air
        a bed. On the bed is: a mattress. On the mattress is: a white pillow..
        a closet. The closet door is open. In the closet is: nothing.
        a drawing
        a table. On the table is: nothing.
        unknown substance B
You also see:
        A door to the hallway (that is open)
Thought: Ah, I've found the unknown substance B! Now I need to focus on it to take its temperature. I'll use the thermometer to do so.
Action: use thermometer
Observation: No known action matches that input.
Thought: I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I need to specify the action more clearly. I'll try again. I'll focus on the thermometer first, then use it to measure the temperature of the unknown substance B.
Action: focus on thermometer
Observation: No known action matches that input.
Thought: I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I need to specify the action more clearly. I'll try again. I'll examine the thermometer to see what it's capable of.
Action: examine thermometer
Observation: No known action matches that input.

STATUS: FAIL

New plan: I need to ensure I first locate and inspect the thermometer, confirming its functionality and proper calibration. Carefully approaching unknown substance B to avoid contamination or damage, I will then use the thermometer to accurately measure its temperature. Based on the measurement: If the temperature exceeds 200.0 degrees Celsius, I will place it in the yellow box. If it is below 200.0 degrees Celsius, it will go into the purple box. This approach will help me avoid the mistakes I made previously and successfully complete the task.
