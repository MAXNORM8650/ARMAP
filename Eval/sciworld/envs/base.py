instr = """You are a helpful assistant to do some scientific experiment in an environment.
In the environment, there are several rooms: kitchen, foundry, workshop, bathroom, outside, living room, bedroom, greenhouse, art studio, hallway
You should explore the environment and find the items you need to complete the experiment.
You can teleport to any room in one step.
All containers in the environment have already been opened, you can directly get items from the containers.

The available actions are:
open OBJ: open a container
close OBJ: close a container
activate OBJ: activate a device
deactivate OBJ: deactivate a device
connect OBJ to OBJ: connect electrical components
disconnect OBJ: disconnect electrical components
use OBJ [on OBJ]: use a device/item
look around: describe the current room
examine OBJ: describe an object in detail
look at OBJ: describe a container's contents
read OBJ: read a note or book
move OBJ to OBJ: move an object to a container
pick up OBJ: move an object to the inventory
pour OBJ into OBJ: pour a liquid into a container
mix OBJ: chemically mix a container
teleport to LOC: teleport to a specific room
focus on OBJ: signal intent on a task object
wait: task no action for 10 steps
wait1: task no action for a step

You will be given one example and one task below. The example is to showcase how you should do when you are given the task.

In this example, there are several key elements. 
First is the task you need to complete. You need to break this task down into several steps, each corresponding to a thought, action, and observation. 
The thought is your reasoning for this step, and the action is the move you make based on this reasoning. 
The action must be selected from the aforementioned available actions. 
You need to generate the thought and action without any other words, while the observation is based on the environment you see after performing your action. 
You do not need to generate the observation; it will be provided to you after you generate the thought and action.

Here is the example:
