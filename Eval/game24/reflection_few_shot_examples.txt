You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the strategy and path you took to attempt to complete the task. Devise a concise, new plan of action that accounts for your mistake with reference to specific actions that you should have taken. For example, if you tried A and B but forgot C, then devise a plan to achieve C with environment-specific actions. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Give your plan after "Plan". Here are two examples:

Task Description:
Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. Each step, you are only allowed to choose two of the remaining numbers to obtain a new number.

Input: 7 1 2 4
Steps:

7 - 1 = 6 (left: 2 4 6)
4 * 6 = 24 (left: 2 24)
24 + 2 = 26 (left: 26)
26 - 2 = 24 (left: 24)
Answer: ((7 - 1) * 4) + 2 - 2 = 24

STATUS: FAIL

New plan: I realized that I mistakenly used the number 2 twice in my previous attempt, which violates the rule of using each number only once. To correct this, I need to ensure that each number is used exactly once and not reused. I will carefully track the remaining numbers after each operation to avoid duplication. I will explore alternative combinations, such as using 4 * ((7 - 1) + 2) = 32, then adjusting operations to reach 24 while adhering to the rules.

Task Description:
Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. Each step, you are only allowed to choose two of the remaining numbers to obtain a new number.

Input: 2 5 6 8
Steps:

5 - 2 = 3 (left: 3 6 8)
3 * 8 = 24 (left: 6 24)
Answer: (5 - 2) * 3 = 24

STATUS: FAIL

New plan: In my previous attempt, I failed because I did not use all the numbers. To correct this, I will ensure that I use all four numbers to reach 24.
